WEEKEND WARRIORS

WEAPON CHARACTERISTICS

All Warriors can choose 1 ranged weapon and 1 close combat weapon. When you
create a Warrior, you give them a Skill and a Role which will influence which weapons
they can choose. Players can choose to use any of the basic or specialist weapons during
their Warriors activation and can repeat the use of that weapon as long as they have
enough Actions remaining.

Weapons come with their own Characteristics so let’s take a look at those now. 

<h3>
RANGE 
</h3>

Range is the distance a weapon can shoot or be used in. It can be written as one
number, eg 8” (the maximum distance), or two numbers, 3-8” (the minimum and
maximum distance).

A close combat weapon - such as a combat knife or axe - will mostly be Range 0”.
Range 0” means the models must be in base contact. If the Range Characteristic is 1”,
then a part of the attackers base must be within 1” of the targets base.

Longer ranged weapons will be less effective in close range. For example, the Sniper
Rifle or Long Bow has a Range of 3-24”. A Range of 3-24” means that if any part of
the models' bases are positioned within 3” of each other, or more than 24” apart, that
weapon cannot be used. 

<h3>
ATTACKS 
</h3>

The Attack Characteristic tells us how many dice we can roll each time we attack with
the weapon. 

<h3>
POWER 
</h3>

The Power Characteristic tells us the number we can use to modify our Attack dice
result. Here’s an example. The Power Characteristic is +1 and we roll 2 Attack dice.
The result is a 3 and a 4. We can add +1 to each dice result. Therefore, the 3 becomes a
4 and the 4 becomes a 5. 

<h3>
DAMAGE 
</h3>

The Damage Characteristic is written as a number, e.g. 3, and
tells us how many Hearts a Warrior will lose if they take a critical
hit from this weapon or if a normal hit gets through the armour
