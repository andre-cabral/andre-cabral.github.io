ACTIONS RULES

CLIMBING

<h3>
CLIMBING (1 ACTION PENALTY)
</h3>

If the terrain looks climbable, your Warrior can climb it. If a flat, high wall looks like it
would not be climbable, then they can’t climb it (unless, of course, they have some
specialist gear!)

When a Warrior Climbs, they must use the relevant number of Move Actions for the
distance they have climbed, and spend an additional +1 Action as a penalty. This
penalty represents the extra time they would take to climb.

For example, if a warrior has 3 Actions remaining, they can choose to either:

1. Move horizontally 3 times to a total of 6”<br />
2. Climb vertically 2 times to a total of 4” (+1 Action penalty for the climb)<br />
3. Move horizontally 1 time and climb 1 time to a total of 4” (+1 Action penalty for
the climb) <br />

<h3>
CLIMBABLE TERRAIN
</h3>

I recommend making most of your climbable terrain to a height of 3 inches. A 3” climb
would require a Warrior to make a continuous movement of 4” (3” vertically and 1”
horizontally so the base would finish on a flat surface). This would cost a total of 3
Actions: 2 Move Actions + 1 Action penalty to climb.

Climbing is best suited to Warriors with Light Armour as they have more Actions: 5 per
activation. Warriors with Heavy Armour have fewer Actions: 3 per activation. This
difference reflects that those wearing Heavy armour won't be as agile as those wearing
Light or Medium Armour.

Climbing ladders or stairs or sliding down ropes and pipes does not incur the 1 Action
penalty.

Like many rules in Weekend Warriors, the Climbing
penalty is optional. If you’d rather move the
Warriors around freely and without penalties, then
that will make the game easier; especially if
playing with younger players.
