WAYS TO PLAY

GAME MODES

<h3>
GAME MODES
</h3>

With each Skirmish, you can take part in battle modes like capture the flag, defend the
base, escape and evade, and anything else you can imagine.

These game modes can be played as One-Shots or as part of a narrative campaign built
around a scenario, story or idea. 

<h3>
ONE SHOTS
</h3>

Weekend Warriors is a great game to pick up and play. One-Shots are single Skirmishes
that are one-off battles. As these One-Shots aren’t part of a campaign, you won't have
to record anything after the game.

I publish One-Shot scenarios frequently, and some of them include pre-built Warbands
so you can get playing even faster. 

<h3>
CAMPAIGN MODE
</h3>

Campaign Mode is when you play out a story over a number of battles. You can create
your own story and then design battles that help your Warbands progress through it or
you can use one of our Weekend Warrior Campaigns that are published frequently as
battle packs. 

<h3>
OTHER GAME MODES
</h3>

You can take the Weekend Warrior rules and create any game mode you can imagine
and you can find out how to do that here in this book. We’ll be creating fun game modes
in our battle packs where you can play single player mode against AI and or waves of
alien arachnids! Perfect for when the kids don’t want to play with you!
