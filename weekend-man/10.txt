KEY CONCEPTS

CONTACT & ROLL-OFFS

<h3>
CONTACT
</h3>

If a weapon has a range of 0” the models must be in base contact to make an attack
with that weapon.

If a models base is up to 1” above the other model but their base would be in contact if
they were on the same level, they are still said to be in base contact. 

<h3>
ROLL-OFFS
</h3>

Roll-offs are used to decide who goes first or to settle a disagreement. The player who
rolls highest wins the roll-off. If both players roll the same result, roll-off again until one
player wins.

Players will roll-off to see who goes first at the beginning of each round.

If at any time both players can’t agree on
something - for example, how much of a model is
in cover - use a roll-off to decide and then get
back into the action!

<h3>
ROUNDS, ACTIVATIONS & ACTIONS
</h3>

Games usually consist of 4-5 rounds. A round is complete when all models have been
activated and carried out their actions.

Each model will be activated once per round. Players alternate to activate
their models in a ‘you go, I go’ fashion, starting with the player that
won the roll-off. This alternating continues until all Warriors have
been activated.

Actions are things your models can do during their activation.
