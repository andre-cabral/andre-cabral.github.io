THE BATTLEFIELD

TERRAIN

<h3>
TERRAIN
</h3>

Terrain plays a big part in the game and you can use existing terrain pieces from other
games to create your setting. If you don’t have any, then you can use 2D drawings, craft
some 3D terrain of your own with some household junk, or even use boxes and tin cans
from your kitchen cupboard to represent structures.

Once you get playing, your imagination will take over, and a tin of baked beans soon
becomes an industrial storage tank, and a box of cereal takes the place of a central
control building that you need to dominate!

Crafting your terrain together is great fun and something that I highly recommend.
There is nothing better than spending an afternoon crafting buildings and structures
and bringing the environment to life with unique customised warriors represented by
your favourite toys or models.

The amount of terrain you use during a Skirmish is up to you. Having lots of terrain
pieces on the board is fun to play with and helps give extra cover to manoeuvre around.

Try not to overthink it or be too ‘fancy’. You
can see how we use terrain in our YouTube
videos.
