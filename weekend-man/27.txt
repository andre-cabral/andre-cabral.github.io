WARRIOR TOKENS

WARRIOR TOKENS

<h3>
TOKENS 
</h3>

When you create your Warband, each Warrior will receive 2 Warrior Tokens. The 2
tokens must be spent on 1 Skill and 1 Role.

At the end of each Skirmish, each Warrior that took part receives 1 Warrior Token. The
winning Warband also receive a bonus Warrior Token. That bonus Warrior Token may
be given to any of the Warriors in the Warband.

It We like to give the bonus token to the Warrior who did
something special in the Skirmish or carried out a heroic
act, but it’s entirely up to you who gets it and why

<h3>
SPENDING TOKENS 
</h3>

The Warrior Tokens can be spent at the Merchant where you can choose special war
gear and abilities for your Warriors.

The Tokens can be saved up and used for larger items, or you can spend them right
away. Just make a note of any Tokens you keep in your Warriors note section.

Some items are only available to Warriors who have a specific Skill or Role. All the
details for this can be found in the Merchant section of this book.

It’s good fun to use some coins or tokens
to represent the Warrior Tokens rather
than just writing them down.
