<h3>
PLAY IN AN EXISTING UNIVERSE
</h3>

If you are not interested in developing a deeper narrative for your skirmishes, you don’t
have to. But if you do want to - and don’t want to write that narrative yourself - there is
no reason why you can’t look to other games and lore and weave that into your own.
Weekend Warriors is written so that the core rules will fit in nicely with other games.

For example, if you like playing popular skirmish games but find the rules too much for
your kids to play, you can use the backgrounds, lore, and narrative from those games
and then use the Weekend Warriors rule set to play them.

You could even take your favourite movie or TV show and play it out using the
Weekend Warrior rules with your themed toys or miniatures. There is no limit to what
you can do.

Look at popular role-playing games for ideas and inspiration too. There are countless
stories, prompts, scenarios and everything you need to create fun skirmish battles.

out of ready-made scenarios to play!

<h3>
IT’S YOUR GAME
</h3>

Although Weekend Warriors is a game to play with your children, it’s not a children’s
book. It’s written so that you can learn the rules quickly and then teach them as you
play. Building the Warbands together helps to introduce the concepts and rules, and all
the information is kept neatly on one page, so you don’t have to keep checking a book.

Now let's get started going through everything you need to know to put together
the Warbands, create your battlefields, and begin playing Weekend Warriors!
