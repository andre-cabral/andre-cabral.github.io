GETTING STARTED

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

<h3>
BASIC TOOLS
</h3>

Getting started with Weekend Warriors is super easy. The game uses simple tools that
most of us will already have at home, so hopefully, you can use items from your existing
collection. 

Here’s what you need: 

<LIST>
• A 36”x24” gaming surface (or you can use a 24”x24” or popular 30” x 22” board)
• Something to use as Terrain
• A measuring tape or gauge
• Six-sided dice
• Token markers or coins
• 1-10 models per player (4 models per Warband is recommended)
• A printed warrior sheet for each player
• A pencil and eraser
</LIST>

Use your favourite models, toys or miniatures.
Construction minifigs & weapons make for
fantastic Warriors!

<h3>
FUN & IMAGINATION
</h3>

Weekend Warriors is all about having fun, improvising, and using your imagination.
Your gaming surface could be a tabletop, the garden patio, even the beach! Your terrain
can be from your favourite game manufacturer or you could use household items like
food tins, sticks and rocks from the garden or even create hills in the sandpit. You can be
as simple or as fancy as you like!

We love to craft our terrain using foam sheets, cardboard, and interesting junk
items we’ve collected. That way we get to spend time carrying out a fun
activity together and build our own worlds to do battle in. If you like the sound
of making some fun terrain, then give it a go! You can spend the week
preparing your skirmishes, writing the narrative, crafting the battlefield, and
creating Quests and Missions as you build up to the weekend when it'll be time
to unleash your inner Warrior and do battle!
