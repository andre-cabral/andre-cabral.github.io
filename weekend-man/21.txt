ASSEMBLE A WARBAND

SELECTING YOUR WARRIORS

<h3>
RIGHT WARRIOR FOR THE JOB 
</h3>

Each Warrior will bring something unique to the Warband, and choosing the right
Warrior for the Quest or Mission is important. How you combine their roles and skills
will make them best suited for specific tactics during each battle.

It’s fun to have a pool of Warriors that you can keep and choose from for each battle.
Over time, as you play lots of games, you can develop the whole pool and have
a strong bunch to choose from.

So even if you only need 4 Warriors for a battle, you could have 10 or more to choose
from. This pool will come into play much more during a campaign as you develop them
over a series of Quests or Missions.

Have fun giving your Warriors traits,
backgrounds, and stories and developing
their characters.

<h3>
DEVELOP YOUR WARBAND
</h3>

You can build an entirely new Warband for each battle or keep the same ones each time.
If you want to grow and develop your Warriors, keep taking them to battle to gain those
awesome Warrior Tokens.

Alternatively, you might want to bring in a rookie or a budding adventure who might
bring a new skill to the Warband. Have fun watching the rookie advance their skills until
they are just as good as the seasoned veterans!

There’s no limit to how many
Warriors you can have!
