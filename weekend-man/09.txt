KEY CONCEPTS

DISTANCE & MODIFIERS

There are a few key concepts to cover before we look at the rules. If you’ve played
skirmish games before, then these key concepts should be familiar. If you are new to the
world of tabletop skirmish games, then key concepts are simply general rules to keep in
mind when playing the game. 

<h3>
DISTANCES & MEASUREMENTS
</h3>

All distances are measured in inches and are written in the rules as a number followed
by the double quote symbol. For example, 5 inches will be written as 5”.

Measurements for attacks are taken from the closest base edge of the attacking model to
the closest base edge of the target model. If one model is higher than the other model,
measure the diagonal distance. If any part of the target base is within the range value,
that target is said to be in range.

Measurements for moving are taken from the front of the moving base to the front of
the moving base along the path the model would move. You can take a measurement
any time during the game, whether it’s your turn or not. 

<h3>
MODIFIERS
</h3>

Modifiers can add or subtract a number to or from dice rolls and will be written as a +1
or -1. The Warrior Card, Weapons, Gear, and Abilities will tell when and where to
apply modifiers.

However, if a dice roll is a natural 6, it’s always a critical hit. If it’s a natural 1, it’s
always an epic fail regardless of modifiers. So when you roll a 1, you can’t add any
modifiers to it.

Modifiers do not make critical hits or epic fails.

For example, a roll of 5 with Strength +1 will make
the result a 6, but this will only count as a hit. This
modifier is still good, though, because the defender
will have to roll a 6 to beat it!
