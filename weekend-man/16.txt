CREATE A SKIRMISH

THE CREATION PROCESS

<h3>
STEP BY STEP
</h3>

Creating a Skirmish is great fun, and you can use the template to make up any
adventure you can imagine. I recommend keeping it simple. Build a framework around
an idea and then let the players use their imaginations to fill in the gaps. 

Here is the step by step process to use with the blank Skirmish Template Sheet that you
can find towards the back of this book

<h3>
1. GIVE THE SKIRMISH A NAME 
</h3>

Decide if this is a Mission or a Quest. Fantasy settings sound better when you go on
Quests, while sci-fi settings better suit a Mission. The name can be serious, funny or
whimsical, or it can tell the players exactly what the quest or mission is all about. Our
Mission name, “Retrieve The Intel”, is self-explanatory and sets the scene right away. 

<h3>
2. WRITE A BRIEF
</h3>

The Brief should be just that! Use the small area to describe why the teams are going to
do battle, include a brief history if you want to, and outline the tasks and goals the
Warbands need to carry out.

Again, keep it simple; a brief outline is all you need.
The story will unfold when the players do battle!

<h3>
3. EXPLAIN ANY SPECIAL RULES
</h3>

There may be some special rules the players have to adhere to or carry out. Note that
down in this section. They may need to place objectives or set up the Warbands in a
certain way.
