INTRODUCTION

A CREATIVE TEMPLATE

<h3>
CREATE MEMORIES 
</h3>

Weekend Warriors hasn’t been developed around a story or theme. It’s a creative
template that gives you a set of rules and boundaries to work within to create your own
stories and adventures. Because you take control of the narrative and choose which rules
to use and which ones to leave out, it’s great for any age. But the game is perfect for
children aged 7+ when all the rules are in play.

The frequently published Skirmish Battles and Campaign Battle Packs come with selfcontained 
stories, adventures, quests, and missions with narratives built around these
rules.

I hope you will use and enjoy these publications, but I also hope that you will have a go
at writing your own with your children. When you’ve written the story yourself and see
your kids having fun with it, it’s such a great feeling. Those memories will stay with you
all and you’ll be talking about them for years to come.

and played together with a dwarf named Warf and a
knight who wielded the mighty Sword of Justice!”

<h3>
WHAT STORY WILL YOU TELL?
</h3>

Creating and playing with our children means we will never run out of fun and wacky
stories and ideas to build a skirmish around. When you design a Skirmish, you fill out
the brief, and the brief is all you need to create a fun Skirmish battle scenario. But if
you enjoy storytelling, go a little further and write a background story!

You can make your story as in-depth and complex as you like or build a simple
framework that allows the players to develop the story as they play through
the campaign skirmishes.

When you set back a little time to create the stories with your kids, it gets them
involved and helps them to take ownership of the game too.
