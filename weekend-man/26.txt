WARRIOR CARD

THE WARRIOR CARD


The Warrior card is where we record all of the Warrior and Weapon Characteristics
and any items and gear the Warrior accrues. Each player can use a Warband Sheet that
contains 4 Warrior Cards (the recommended number of Warriors). You can use this to
keep track of all their statistics, tokens, gear cards, and notes on just one piece of paper.

Building your Warbands together is great fun, and because your kids have gone through
these stages with you, it’s much easier for them to understand and remember what their
Warriors can do on the battlefield. It also feels less like following rules and more like
they have created the rules themselves!

The example below describes how to complete a Warrior Card:
