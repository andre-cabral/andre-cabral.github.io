ACTION RULES

MOVEMENT - SPECIAL RULES

<h3>
OPTIONAL BUT AWESOME!
</h3>

These movement special rules are optional but definitely add to the game. 

<h4>In Close Combat:</h4> Your Warrior cannot make a movement when in base contact with
an enemy Warrior. See the Push rule to learn how to move out of close combat.

<h4>Jumping:</h4> Your Warrior can jump horizontally across open spaces to the amount of
their Movement Characteristic. For example, if a Movement characteristic is 2”, they
can jump a gap or space up to 2”.

<h4>Falling:</h4> Falling does not cost any movement inches. A Warrior can fall down any
distance of 3” or less without suffering any damage. But if the distance they fall is more
than 3”, then they lose 1 Heart.

<h4>Rough Terrain:</h4> Warriors can move across obstacles or pieces of scatter terrain less
than 1” high as normal. Anything over 1” will slow them down, so a +1 Action penalty
will be placed on the continuous movement.

If a Warrior moves across two separate pieces of rough terrain in one continuous
movement, they must take a +1 penalty for each piece of terrain. 

<POSTIT>
You can designate areas on the battlefield as rough
terrain such as swamps, thick mud, rocky outcrops
and maybe even waterlogged bomb craters. It’s up
to you how and what you assign as rough terrain
during the battlefield design stage.
