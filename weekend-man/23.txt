WARRIOR CARDS

WARRIOR CHARACTERISTICS

Your models represent Warriors. When you combine 1-10 of these Warriors, you will
form a Warband. As Weekend Warriors can be played in any genre, we chose these
generic terms, but you can call your Warband and Warriors anything you like. If
playing a fantasy game, you could use Tribe. Playing in a sci-fi setting, you might want
to use Squad; it’s entirely up to you.

Each Warrior will have their own Warrior Card as shown on the Warband Sheet. These
cards will include all of their Characteristics that decide what they are best at, how they
will perform, and what skills and abilities they have. This section will explain each of
these characteristics and show you how to build a Warrior. 

<h3>
MOVEMENT 
</h3>

Most Warriors move in increments of 2”. Each 2" movement increment will cost 1
Action. In one activation, a Warrior can move any number of times up to their Action
allowance. 

<POSTIT>
For example, if they have 3 Actions remaining,
they can move 3 times.
3 Actions x 2” Distance = 6” Total Distance 
</POSTIT>

<h3>
HEARTS
</h3>

The health of each Warrior is measured in Hearts. All Warrior start with the same 10
Hearts. For each hit or critical hit the Warrior sustains, deduct the number of Hearts
associated with the weapon that attacked them.

When all Hearts are lost, the Warrior will be removed from the battle.
They are not killed but rather suffer too many injuries to continue
in the battle. They live to fight another day!
