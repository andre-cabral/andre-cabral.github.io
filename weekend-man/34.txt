ACTION RULES

<h2>
SLIDING
</h2>

<h3>
SLIDE - 1 ACTION 
</h3>

You can add special features to your terrain pieces, such as ropes, slides, and pipes.
Warriors can Slide down these features without taking a falling penalty. Sliding does not
cost any movement inches, but it will cost 1 Action.

To slide, your Warrior must start the Slide in base contact with the top of the feature
and end the Slide in base contact at the bottom of the feature. 

<h2>
PUSHING
<h2>

<h3>
PUSH - 1 ACTION 
</h3>

If your Warrior is in base contact with an enemy Warrior, they cannot simply move
away as they are likely to be engaged in combat. They can instead use 1 Action to push
the Warrior 1” away from them in any direction. Then they can spend their next Action
to move as normal.

Your Warrior can also choose to follow up for free during a Push Action. If they follow
up, move the enemy Warrior 1” away from them in any direction and then move the
Pushing Warrior in the same direction and place them back in base contact.

Your Warrior can use a Push Action as many times as they like, as long as they have
enough Actions remaining.

If your Warrior pushes another Warrior
and they fall, Falling rules will apply.
