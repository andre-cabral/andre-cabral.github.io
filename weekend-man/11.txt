KEY CONCEPTS

DICE & TOKENS

<h3>
DICE
</h3>

The only dice used in Weekend Warriors are six-sided dice which will be written as 'D6'.
You will need at least six D6 dice, but we recommend having six D6 per player.

Sometimes, you will be asked to roll a D3. We still use a D6 to represent our D3, and
when we roll it, the following results translate to:

Result of 1-2 = 1<br />
Result of 3-4 = 2<br />
Result of 5-6 = 3<br />

<h3>
EXTRA DICE & TOKENS
</h3>

Some people like to record results or keep a score of objective points using extra dice or
tokens. You can use any dice or tokens you like, as long as all players agree.

You will need some tokens or objects to represent the objectives during certain
Skirmishes. In the Monthly Skirmishes we publish, you’ll find custom tokens to print off
and play.

Feel free to use any tokens from other games or have fun making your own custom
objective tokens or 3D pieces. If you don’t have any tokens already and don’t want to
make any custom pieces, you can simply use coins.

Construction toys make excellent tokens! You can
build some awesome objective markers with
interesting pieces and minifig weapons.
