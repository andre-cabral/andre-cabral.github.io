WEEKEND WARRIORS (ACTION RULES)

<h2>
PICK UP & PASS
</h2>

<h3>
PICK UP - 1 ACTION
</h3>

Sometimes you’ll need to pick up a token, item or marker. The Pick Up action will
usually cost 1 Action unless stated otherwise in the Skirmish Rules.

<h3>
PASS
</h3>

If your activated Warrior has any Actions remaining but you do not want to do
anything further with them, you can choose to end their activation and pass. 

<h2>
HEALING
</h2>

<h3>
HEALING - 2 ACTIONS
</h3>

Any Warrior can heal themselves or another Warrior.

Use 2 Actions to carry out a Heal Action. Healing must adhere to the following:

• Your Warrior must be carrying a medi pack or potion OR the warrior they are
healing must be carrying a medi pack or potion.<br />
• Your Warrior must be in base contact with another Warrior to heal them.<br />
• Healing increases the Warriors' health by 1 Heart.<br />
• If a Warrior is reduced to 0 Hearts, they cannot be healed and are removed from the
battlefield. <br />

<POSTIT>
Taking a Medic into battle dramatically
helps with Healing as they carry unlimited
medi packs!
