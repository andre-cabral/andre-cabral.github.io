ACTION RULES

MOVEMENT

<h3>
MOVEMENT - 1 ACTION
</h3>

The distance your Warrior can move is indicated by their Movement Characteristic and
number of Actions. Most Warriors move in increments of up to 2” at a cost of 1 Action
for each increment moved.

In one activation they can move any number of times up to their Action allowance but
must finish the movement (or continuous movement - see below) on a flat surface that
supports their base and allows them to stand freely. 

<h4>
Continuous Movement: 
</h4>

If a Warrior has 2 or more Actions remaining, they can choose to link them together
and make one ‘continuous movement’. For example, during a ‘continuous movement’
where the Warrior has 3 actions remaining, they can move 3 times in one go to a total
distance of 6”.

During a continuous movement, your Warrior can use all the different movements.
They can move in any direction, over terrain, climb up or down walls, and jump across
gaps, but it’s up to you to use your judgement to decide what is out of bounds.

For example, a Warrior with 3 actions can use a continuous movement to walk 2”, jump
across a gap no wider than 2” (even if your Warriors base is not supported on a flat
surface at the end of the jump) and then continue to walk another 2”. 

<POSTIT>
Movement in Weekend Warriors is designed to be fluid,
dynamic and fun. So be creative, link all the different
movements, and take advantage of the terrain. If any
movement seems dubious or your opponent raises a
concern, you can roll-off to decide if it’s possible.
