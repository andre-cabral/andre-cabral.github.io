<h3>
WHAT’S A SKIRMISH?
</h3>

‘Skirmish’ is the term for a Mission or Quest that lays out all the information you need
to do battle in a specific scenario. We like to use the term ‘Quest’ if playing a fantasy
game or ‘Mission’ if playing a sci-fi or modern game.

This book contains 3 Fantasy Quests and 3 Sci-fi Missions to get you started. Each
month I publish at least one new Fantasy Quest and one new Sci-fi Mission, and these
are available to purchase on my website or to download for free if you are a Patreon
Supporter.

It’s up to you how you name your Skirmishes, but
when we publish them, we generally call them
‘Quests’ or ‘Missions’.

<h3>
QUESTS & MISSIONS
</h3>

You'll also find Quests and Missions published for many other genres, including modern
warfare, historical times, zombie outbreak, apocalypse, and Animal Town.

We encourage you to have a go at creating your own Quests and Missions and provide
you with a template and instructions to do it here in the book. This is a fun activity to
carry out with your children and a great way to use their imagination and develop their
creative skills.

The following pages provide you with an example Skirmish, with notes, a template to
create your own, and the Quests and Missions to get started. You can also find more 
indepth how-to videos on my YouTube Channel.
