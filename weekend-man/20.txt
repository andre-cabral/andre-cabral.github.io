ASSEMBLE A WARBAND

STEPS TO BUILD A WARBAND

<h3>
4 STEPS …
</h3>

Groups of Warriors are called Warbands and consist of 1-10 Warriors. We recommend
using 4 Warriors per player per skirmish, especially when starting out. You can use more
or less if you choose but make sure that each player has the same number of Warriors
for each skirmish.

There are 4 steps you need to follow when building your Warband. 

<h4>
1. Give your Warband a name: 
</h4>
Set the tone of your Warband with a fun or sinister name! 

<h4>
2. Choose your Warriors:
</h4>
Decide how many Warriors you will be taking to battle and select some miniatures to
represent them. 

<h4>
3. Fill out their Warrior Cards:
</h4>
Follow the instructions in the ‘How To Create A Warrior’ section. 

<h4>
4. Choose 1 Warband Perk:
</h4>
Use the Warband Perk table to either select or roll for a random perk. The Warband
Perk builds into the narrative of your Warband and gives them a special advantage
during the battle.

You can change the Warband Perk for each
Quest or Mission, so choose wisely to help
meet those objectives!
