THE RULES

ROUNDS, ACTIVATIONS & ACTIONS

<h3>
ROUNDS
</h3>

Each battle usually consists of 4-5 rounds. At the start of the first round, players will
roll-off to decide who sets up their Warriors on the battlefield first. Whoever rolls the
highest decides who places the first Warrior. Then, players alternate placing their
Warriors until all are placed on the battlefield.

Some Quests or Missions may specify that a certain
player sets up first. These special rules will be
written on each Skirmish Sheet.

<h3>
ACTIVATIONS
</h3>

At the start of each round, players will roll-off to decide who activates the first Warrior.
Whoever rolls the highest wins the roll-off. If it’s a tie, then re-roll again until one player
wins.

Each Warrior is activated once per round. Players take turns activating their Warriors in
a ‘you go, I go’ fashion until all Warriors have been activated. 

<POSTIT>
As Warriors are taken out, a player might have
more Warriors in the battle. That player keeps
activating their Warriors until they have all been
activated.
