CREATE A SKIRMISH

THE CREATION PROCESS CONTINUED

<h3>
4. LET PLAYERS KNOW HOW TO WIN
</h3>

Make this section as clear and concise as possible. It could be an elimination or
assassination mission, where the Warbands have to eliminate each other’s designated
leader to win. The Warband that takes out the opponent's designated leader first wins. 

<h3>
5. WHAT’S THE PRIZE?
</h3>

Make sure the winner gets a prize. This can be the Bonus Token or a special item of
gear from the search tables. 

<h3>
6. DRAW THE BATTLE MAP
</h3>

The battle map is an important part of the Skirmish creation process. You can use the
map to show deployment zones, objectives, terrain layout, and much more. Just like the
rest of the process, keep it simple and only include what is necessary. Take a look at the
maps included in the Quests and Missions to get an idea of how it’s done.

If you like drawing, you can make
your maps as detailed and
elaborate as you like!
