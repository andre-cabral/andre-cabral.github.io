PREPARE FOR BATTLE

BATTLEFIELD & OBJECTIVES 

<h3>
BATTLEFIELD
</h3>

The Battlefield is where your Skirmish will take place. This battlefield can be a fancy
game mat or board or just an area that you mark out on your kitchen table or even in
the garden.

Your Battlefield will have terrain, areas of deployment, and more. This will all be
detailed in the individual Skirmish rules.

The Battlefield size that is recommended for Weekend Warriors is 36” by 24” or the
popular 30” by 22”. This size is just a guide, though, and you can use 24” x 24” or even
36” x 36”; especially if playing with more than 4 Warriors per player. If you use a
different size board, you can change the deployment zones to reflect it or redraw them
to better suit the size.

Some of the most popular skirmish games use a
30” x 22” game board or mat. These are perfect and
readily available.

<h3>
OBJECTIVES
</h3>

Objectives can be represented with tokens or items like chests, other miniatures or even
parts from other toys. These represent certain things your Warriors have to collect or
interact with to gain points and win the game.

You can make your own, buy them from your favourite game creators or use anything
you have at home already that sparks your imagination.

For Easter-themed games, you could use
mini chocolate eggs. Let the players eat
them as they win each objective!
